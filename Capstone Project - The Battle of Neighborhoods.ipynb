    "A prospective business owner wants to start his new business by developing both online and physical distribution for high-end products. The owner desires to know where he should starts his business in a city that has been not been fully developed or ignored. This would allow to minimise the risk, generate revenu rapidely and develop faster. He also want to know where he should look within a city to install his shop based on previous data and evaluate, if possible, trends.\n",

    "3. Find the locations for the shop in the category for the list of city.\n",

    "2. That for that specific product/category there is no variations across countries (no regionality).\n",

    "3. Are these category of shops established within a larger network (for example a place for coworking as few coffees shop around) that attract most of the clientele ?\n",
